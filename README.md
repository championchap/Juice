# Juice #

A simple HTML5 game framework made in [Haxe](http://haxe.org).

Why Juice? Because Haxe is Orange and JS sounds a bit like Juice if you say it wrong. Juh Sss instead of Jay Ess. 

At the moment Juice renders to a HTML Canvas. I'll think about adding WebGL support in the future, but right now I'm fairly happy with the Canvas, so don't wait up.
