# Juice

A simple HTML5 game framework made in [Haxe](http://haxe.org).

Why Juice? Because Haxe is Orange and JS sounds a bit like Juice if you say it wrong. Juh Sss instead of Jay Ess. 

At the moment Juice renders to a HTML Canvas. I'll think about adding WebGL support in the future, but right now I'm fairly happy with the Canvas, so don't wait up.


## Features (planned and completed)

* Canvas Rendering 
* Keyboard and Mouse Input 
* Full Screen
* Sprites
* Spritesheet animation
* Sounds
* Tile Maps 
* Physics 
* Particles 
* Camera 
* Tweens 
* Groups 
* Collision Detection 
* Object Pools 
* Preloader


## Requirements

* [Haxe](http://haxe.org)
* Probably [Actuate](https://github.com/openfl/actuate) for Tweens eventually.
* Probably [Nape](https://github.com/deltaluca/nape) for Physics eventually. 


## Demo

Coming soon! Demo projects will be available under a new repo.


## Usage

__Please don't use this yet! I'm still working on it, it probably doesn't work.__

At the moment I am uploading the source of a sort of test project with Juice. 

Inside src but above juice are the [source files](https://github.com/championchap/Juice/tree/master/src), check them out if you are interesed in how this works.
